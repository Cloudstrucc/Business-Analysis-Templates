# Business Analysis Templates for Technology Implementations

A collection of comprehensive, business-friendly templates designed to streamline requirements gathering, implementation planning, and client sign-off for technology projects.

## Purpose

Technology implementations often fail not because of technical challenges, but because of unclear requirements, missed stakeholder expectations, and poor communication between technical teams and business users. These templates bridge that gap by:

- **Translating technical features into business language** — Helping non-technical stakeholders understand what they're getting and make informed decisions
- **Standardizing the discovery process** — Ensuring consistent, thorough requirements gathering across projects
- **Reducing implementation rework** — Capturing decisions upfront rather than discovering gaps mid-project
- **Creating accountability** — Providing clear documentation of what was agreed upon, with formal sign-off sections
- **Accelerating onboarding** — Giving new team members a structured framework to follow

## Who Are These Templates For?

- **Business Analysts** conducting requirements workshops and client interviews
- **Solution Architects** scoping implementation efforts
- **Project Managers** ensuring nothing falls through the cracks
- **Consultants** delivering professional, repeatable client engagements
- **Internal IT Teams** rolling out new platforms to business units

## What's Included

Each template provides:

- **Feature explanations in plain language** — No jargon, no assumptions about technical knowledge
- **Decision checkboxes** — Simple OOB (Out of Box) / N/A / Customize response options
- **Consideration questions** — Prompts to uncover business requirements that clients may not think to mention
- **Official documentation links** — Direct references to vendor documentation for deeper exploration
- **Sign-off sections** — Formal approval areas for project governance
- **Glossaries** — Definitions of key terms for reference
